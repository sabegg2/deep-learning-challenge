# Report on the Neural Network Model

Deep Learning Charity Funding Outcome Predictor Project using hyper-tuned Neural Networks.

## Overview:

I've created a tool for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup that can help it select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I have used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We were set a target of 75% accuracy for our model. From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

- `EIN` and `NAME`—Identification columns
- `APPLICATION_TYPE`—Alphabet Soup application type
- `AFFILIATION`—Affiliated sector of industry
- `CLASSIFICATION`—Government organization classification
- `USE_CASE`—Use case for funding
- `ORGANIZATION`—Organization type
- `STATUS`—Active status
- `INCOME_AMT`—Income classification
- `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`—Special consideration for application
- `ASK_AMT`—Funding amount requested
- `IS_SUCCESSFUL` —Was the money used effectively
